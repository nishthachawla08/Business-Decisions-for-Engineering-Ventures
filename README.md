The Business Plan &amp; Pitch Deck was created for coursework in APSC 540 - Entrepreneurial Thinking for Applied Scientists.  The business plan is to introduce ‘DigiWallet’, a cloud platform for storage, sharing and verification of documents &amp; certificates. It is a mobile application which aims to provide paperless governance. This is a platform where the user can store and verify the documents or certificates digitally. DigiWallet aims to target the problems in identity documentation space by replacing the physical ids with digital ID’s.
